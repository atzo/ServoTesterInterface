## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ServoTesterInterface.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser that supports:
   - Web Serial API (for USB connections)
   - Web Bluetooth API (for Bluetooth connections)
   - Modern JavaScript features
   - SVG manipulation

### Local Development Server

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: When running the project locally, you must use a local web server due to Web Serial API security requirements. Opening the HTML file directly (`file://` protocol) will not allow Web Serial connections.

You can use any of these methods to start a local server:

#### Using Node.js
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server
npm install -g http-server

# Start the server in the project directory
http-server
```

#### Using Python
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

#### Using Apache
If you have Apache installed, you can configure it to serve the project directory.

#### Using Visual Studio Code
If you're using VS Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" to start a local server.

After starting a local server, access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by your server).

## Usage

1. **Connection Setup**
   - Use the USB or Bluetooth connection buttons to connect to your servo controller
   - Ensure your device supports the required connection method

2. **Servo Configuration**
   - Set the number of servos (1-16)
   - Configure each servo's name, type, and limits
   - Toggle servo visibility in the control panel

3. **Motion Programming**
   - Double-click on the timeline to add keyframes
   - Drag keyframes to adjust timing and position
   - Use control points to shape the motion path
   - Adjust the base frame for initial positions

4. **Project Management**
   - Save your project using the Save button
   - Load existing projects using the Load button
   - Start fresh with the New Project button
   - Projects are auto-saved to prevent data loss

## Technical Details

- Timeline coordinates use a 0-100 scale for position (x-axis)
- Servo angles range from 0-180 degrees (y-axis)
- Motion paths use cubic Bezier curves for smooth interpolation
- Relative control point positions ensure consistent motion when keyframes move
- SVG-based visualization provides precise control and smooth rendering

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (recommended) - Full support for Web Serial and Web Bluetooth
- Firefox - Limited support (no Web Serial)
- Safari - Limited support (no Web Serial/Bluetooth)

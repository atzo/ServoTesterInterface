# Servo Tester Interface

A web-based interface for programming and testing servo motors with an intuitive visual timeline. Create smooth servo motion sequences using interactive Bezier curves, manage multiple servos, and save your configurations.

## Application Access
The application is available at: [https://atzo.github.io/ServoTesterInterface/](https://atzo.github.io/ServoTesterInterface/)

### Browser Compatibility
- **Google Chrome/Edge (Recommended)**
  - Full support for all features
  - Best performance and stability
  - Complete Web Serial and Web Bluetooth API support
- **Firefox**
  - Limited functionality
  - No Web Serial API support (USB connection not available)
  - Web Bluetooth API support varies by version
- **Safari**
  - Limited functionality
  - No Web Serial API support
  - No Web Bluetooth API support
  - Not recommended for use

Note: The application is fully functional except for the hardware connection features (USB and Bluetooth) which are currently under development. Browser support for these features may improve in future browser versions.

## Development Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently in active development** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The interface is functional but may undergo significant changes as development continues. New features and improvements are being added regularly.

### Missing Components
The following interface components are currently under development:
- USB and Bluetooth connection implementation
- Timeline scrubber for animation preview and control

## Hardware Integration

This project is part of a larger system that includes a microcontroller-based hardware component for servo control. The hardware component:
- Supports multiple servo control protocols
- Can handle multiple servos simultaneously
- Provides real-time servo position control
- Manages hardware-level servo operations

## Key Features
- Visual timeline editor with Bezier curve interpolation
- Support for up to 16 servos with individual controls
- Real-time motion path editing with draggable control points

## Usage

1. **Connection Setup**
   - Use the USB or Bluetooth connection buttons to connect to your servo controller
   - Ensure your device supports the required connection method

2. **Servo Configuration**
   - Set the number of servos (1-16)
   - Configure each servo's name, type, and limits
   - Toggle servo visibility in the control panel

3. **Motion Programming**
   - Double-click on the timeline to add keyframes
   - Drag keyframes to adjust timing and position
   - Use control points to shape the motion path
   - Adjust the base frame for initial positions

4. **Project Management**
   - Save your project using the Save button
   - Load existing projects using the Load button
   - Start fresh with the New Project button
   - Projects are auto-saved to prevent data loss

## Technical Details

- Timeline coordinates use a 0-100 scale for position (x-axis)
- Servo angles range from 0-180 degrees (y-axis)
- Motion paths use cubic Bezier curves for smooth interpolation
- Relative control point positions ensure consistent motion when keyframes move
- SVG-based visualization provides precise control and smooth rendering

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (recommended) - Full support for Web Serial and Web Bluetooth
- Firefox - Limited support (no Web Serial)
- Safari - Limited support (no Web Serial/Bluetooth)
